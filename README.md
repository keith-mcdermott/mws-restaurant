## Description

This project involved converting a static web page (starter code available at https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) to a mobile-ready web application. It included adding responsive design elements, WAI-compliant accessibility features, and a ServiceWorker to optimize offline viewing.

## Where to Find

Files can be viewed, cloned or downloaded at https://github.com/keith-mcdermott/mws-restaurant. To run, use a simple Python HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer, and with the server running, visit: http://localhost:8000. (If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 -- or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use. For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000).
